    - add possibility to extract thumbnails as well ? (using convert in a first step)

- Directory vs Pages
   - Page = little content, live edition, kind of "wiki" like (aggregation & so)
   - Directory = huge list of archives, with little friendlyness but possibility to make reports from its content easily
- broken:
    - editing some markdown in view mode
    - ctrl+save in edit mode for markdown
    - 'live' markdown preview in edit mode
    - comments & ratings are partially broken and the behavior is horrible, switch to ajaj !!
