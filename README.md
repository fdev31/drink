# Drink

Alpha Web framework & sample mini CMS application with little
dependencies: ZODB , bottle & markdown. Aims to be quite generic
*"all-in-one-but-minimalistic"* web+database framework.

## Getting sources/Contributing

See [GitHub page][].

## The main ideas behind

It should handle most of javascript, html & forms creation for you, for
very fast prototype implementation.

Then you'r free to put your hands into html/css/js and customize to your
precise requirements.

### Goals

-   Add features at ONE place in ONE language (html/css/js may be
    required for some advanced/custom usages)
-   Be fast, with built-in search engine
-   Ajax (ajaj in fact) - with nice fallbacks for old browsers
-   No SQL
-   Website: as simple as a nested dict-like objects tree, endpoints
    (last element of URL) are object's properties & methods
-   Make it as productive as possible for most generic tasks

Out of the box, it is something between a wiki and a cms, probably a
good base for a lightweight web CMS / Intranet / Forum / etc!

## Main Features

-   Built-in search engine
-   Automatic object edition's form generation
-   Multi-user with access control (group based) at each level
-   Automatic *"views"* of your content, with regard to each object
    permissions
-   Webpage edition live preview, client-side form validation
-   Comes with some pre-developped objects:

    -   folder index (sortable with D&D)
    -   file (upload your own file, also allows D&D)
    -   Web page ( markdown only )
    -   Simple TODO list/TODOs (WIP)

    And of course special elements like Groups & Users !.

-   Very user friendly (once doc will be there!)

## Issues

-   no documentation yet (default manager account, login/password:
    `admin/admin` )
-   no auto tests yet
-   not very powerful yet

## Release changes

-   Add a nice Help by default
-   Add a custom wsgi loader that gracefully loads the fastest
    compatible wsgi backend available
-   Finder now also deletes traces of old objects
-   Add support for *"full"* search in finder
-   add Indent/Deindent support to Markdown editor
-   As always: Fixes & Bugs
