# Drink

Alpha Web framework & sample mini CMS.

Aims to be quite generic *all-in-one-but-minimalistic* web+database high-level framework.

## Dependencies

Use "easy_install" or "pip" to get 'jinja2', 'markdown', 'ZODB3' and 'whoosh' installed on your system.
Additionally you can install *paste* or *gevent* for better performances.

Example (at the DOS/Console/Shell prompt):

     easy_install -U markdown
     easy_install -U jinja2
     easy_install -U ZODB3
     easy_install -U whoosh

 or, alternatively:

     pip install -U markdown
     pip install -U jinja2
     pip install -U ZODB3
     pip install -U whoosh

### Install

Just fetch the source archive and unpack it:

     wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/drink/drink-DRINK_VERSION.tar.bz2
     tar jxvf drink-DRINK_VERSION.tar.bz2

### Running

Just go into the unpacked drink directory and execute the "manage" script:

     cd drink-DRINK_VERSION
     ./manage

If you run into troubles, try:

     DEBUG=1 ./manage

## The main ideas behind

It should handle most of javascript, html & forms creation for you, for
very fast prototype implementation.

Then you'r free to put your hands into html/css/js and customize to your
precise requirements.

Some debugging middleware are supported, edit drink/settings.ini for details.

### Goals

-   Add features at ONE place in ONE language (html/css/js may be
    required for some advanced/custom usages)
-   Be fast, with built-in search engine
-   Ajax (ajaj in fact) - with nice fallbacks for old browsers
-   No SQL
-   Website: as simple as a nested dict-like objects tree, endpoints
    (last element of URL) are object's properties & methods
-   Make it as productive as possible for most generic tasks

Out of the box, it is something between a wiki and a cms, probably a
good base for a lightweight web CMS / Intranet / Forum / etc!

## Main Features

-   Built-in search engine
-   Multi-user with access control (group based) at each level
-   Automatic *views* and javascript-friendly requests, with regard to each object
    permissions
-   Automatic object edition's form generation
-   Webpage edition live preview, client-side form validation
-   Comes with some pre-developped objects:

    -   folder index (sortable with D&D)
    -   file (upload your own file, also allows D&D)
    -   Web page ( markdown only )
    -   Simple TODO list/TODOs (WIP)

    And of course special elements like Groups & Users !.

-   Very user friendly (once doc will be there!)

## Issues

-   no documentation yet (default manager account, login/password:
    `admin/admin` )
-   no auto tests yet
-   not very powerful yet

## Release changes

-   Slightly better access/permissions redirects
-   Improved item addition a bit
-   As always: Fixes & Bugs

## Roadmap

### 0.1 (wip)

- abstract all low-level models (blobs...)
- review 401 handling, ask for login/passwd in case of new session (to be finished)
- fix markdown preview css (make it seamless)
- add calltips everywhere
- change cookie on password change
- pack should call http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/api/index.html?highlight=optimize#whoosh.index.Index.optimize on whoosh
- only accept object move if it succeded on server
- allow custom extensions
- default content for every user
- Per-user group-list, showing in permissions panels
- allow rss via http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/RSS
- HomePage object: Login-splash+UserDashboard write user homepages (with login & passwd & name & surname change) / splash-like if not logged-in
- allow objects to add custom actions in admin bar
- think about comments ( as property of some Model ?) - commentlist ?
- edit form: only send "dirty" values when possible
- add some recursive permissions setter
- improve task list
   - add view form that allow edition by double-clicking
   - integrate fullcalendar
- theme support (config entry + template & static path)
- add more types to default form edition
    * object_path
- find the cleanest way to make all incoming URLs ends with /
- add proper checks at server side too (in add  & edit methods mostly)
- Form object?

Fixes:

- /users as user => 401 (should list instead)
- search => 401 by default (should be allowed)
- mask file upload widget if File not available here
- investigate fileupload D&D bugs
  - files >4GB are making crazy js loops
  - files ~>500MB may hang the request & cause timeout
