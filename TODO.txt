before 0.1:

- find the cleanest way to make all incoming URLs ends with /
- fix, rewrite & improve task list
- integrate showdown
- File upload + test blob
- improve init so it can set default groups ('open' or 'admin')
- test if groups are really shared or if it's better to keep them strings
- add proper checks at server side too (in add  & edit methods mostly)
- D&D sortable folders
- "background processes" for each user / sessions
- theme support (config entry + template & static path)
- finish default edition method (add form)
- add more types to default form edition
   - editable_types = {
        'name': TypeObj,
         ...
        }
   - types:
        * date
        * caption
        * text
        * integer
        * object_path (later)
